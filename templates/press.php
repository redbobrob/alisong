      “Jenkins’ voice was the high point of the show… as was her incredible stage presence.” –  A.V. Testani, The Peak

</br>
      “Alison Jenkins as the T-Rex was a vocal powerhouse and although she has limited stage time, milked every moment of it with ease.”-Cassady Ranford, Vancity Buzz

      “Of the non-human leads, the chorus of “Clever Girls,” literally man-eating glamour-girl tap-dancing raptors and the diva T-Rex were the real stars of the show…”-FunFunVancouver
</br>
      “…actress Alison Jenkins owns it when she finally does show up. Everyone else is cute when they sing, but the Tyrannosaurus Rex is operatic. She dominates. She is a force of nature, and Alison Jenkins plays her like one.”-Living Myth Magazine
